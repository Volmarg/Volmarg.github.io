The project has a little `guide mode` which displays pop-ups when hovering over GUI elements. Keep in mind that some 
pop-ups are not a part of the `guide mode` and these can't be turned off, like for example: actions.

:::note
In order to turn the guide mode **off** it's required to change the content of the `.env` file:
* from `APP_GUIDE=true`
* to `APP_GUIDE=false`
